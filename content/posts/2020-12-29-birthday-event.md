Our latest event went off successfully! For Ben's birthday, we hosted a number of games throughout the day, mixing it up between Trouble Brewing and Sects and Violets. Hilarity and chaos ensued, which was to be expected. We had a number of storytellers craft the tale of our fateful town, including:

- Rasmuffin
- Bennie
- Lindsay
- Dumbleflower

Thanks to all who participated!

## Interesting moments:

In one game of Sects and Violets, Bennie (the demon) had been identified as the demon by the artist. The final day as begun, the artist has revealed his information. The town is prepared to execute, when the traveling bone collector (Lindsay) enters the town. As the town establishes its reasons to execute Bennie, Lindsay asks for clarification on who has what roles. Each townsfolk declares their publicly claimed role, the last of whom was the Mutant (who had just died the previous night). Immediately, the Mutant is executed again - the Bone Collector had activated the Mutant's ability again during the night! Bennie the demon is spared, and evil is able to win the day.

Looking forward to seeing you at our next event!
