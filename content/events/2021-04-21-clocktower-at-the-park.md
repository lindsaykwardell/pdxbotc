If the weather is looking pleasant we will once again host BOTC in-person and in Sellwood Park.


Please join us every other Saturday for in-person games.



In-person guidelines are noted below:



1. Play outside on a nice day in a large open field
2. BYOLS: bring your own liquid and snacks
3. BYOC: bring your own chair
4. Chairs will be placed a few feet apart from one another
5. All players wear masks
6. All players will not touch one another
7. Characters will be randomly assigned and shown to each player (no contact between player & tokens)
8. The storyteller will use a rod to tap on a knee to wake and give information
9. Sidebars may be conducted but only by creating a proper distance between other players
