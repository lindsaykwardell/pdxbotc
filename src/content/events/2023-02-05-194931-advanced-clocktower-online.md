On Wednesdays, we welcome players of all experience levels to play Blood on the Clocktower. Depending on who is there, we may run the official base three scripts or playtested custom scripts. Keep an eye on the #online-events channel for script polls and logistics updates.

We will be playing in the official application at the following link:
